# Project Manager
Forked from [danielbrodin/atom-project-manager](https://github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager) with following differences:

- Append project to current window by default, you can hold shift to open project in new window or same window.
- Scan git repository in multi-paths, you can set `projectHome` like `path1, path2` instead of single path.

## Use my fork

Required uninstall original project-manager first, then:

```bash
~> git clone https://github.com/jysperm/atom-project-manager.git
~> npm install
~> apm link
```
